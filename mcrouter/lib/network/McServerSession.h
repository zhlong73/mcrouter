   * call, by which point all of the following must have occured:
   *   1) All outstanding requests have been replied and pending
   *      writes have been completed/errored out.
   *   2) The outgoing connection is closed, either via an explicit close()
   *      call or due to some error.
   *
   * onCloseStart() callback marks the beggining of session
   * teardown. The application can inititate any cleanup process. After
   * onCloseStart() the socket is no longer readable, and the application
   * should try to flush out all outstanding requests so that session
   * can be closed.
   *
   * The application may use onCloseFinish() callback as the point in
   * time after which the session is considered done, and no event loop
   * iteration is necessary.
   *
   * The session will be alive for the duration of onCloseFinish callback,
   * but this is the last time the application can safely assume that
   * the session is alive.
   *
   * The onWriteQuiescence() callback is invoked when all pending writes are
   * done, rather than invoking it for each write.
   *
   * @param transport  Connected transport; transfers ownership inside
   *                   this session.
